This python script scrapes the distance and duration for a map route, given origin and destination. 

## Project Requirements:
* Has to be free and lightweight => therefore non-usage of external API is preferred; Only duration and distance is needed 
* Used only twice a year

* Output to csv?

## Technical tool considerations
* Python is one of the best and easiest web scraping languages. Besides that, it has a simple syntax and is fast to develop, suitable for our non-complex mini project
* Tried to use the requests_html library, but had difficulty rendering the js of our particular Third Party map service so resorted to Selenium.


## Future Improvements
Optimize time spent waiting for each render after click
